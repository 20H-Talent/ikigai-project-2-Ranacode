# Second project for the 20h talent ikigai bootcamp

## Goal

Make a responsive layout starting with **"mobile first"** and giving the behaviour to adapt the design for both, **_tablet and desktop._**

### Tools and concepts using in this project:

- Visual Studio Code
- BEM Methodology to write CSS rules
- CSS Media Queries
- CSS Flexbox
- Semantic HTML5
- W3C validated

### W3C validation

#### The only warning I have it's not relevant because is something related to simulate text paragraphs with Lorem Ipsum.
